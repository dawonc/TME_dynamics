# Evolutionary Patterns of Tumor Microenvironments at Recurrent Glioma

## Project Objective
Glioblastoma is a malignant brain tumor that has a high risk of tumor recurrence because of its heterogeneous nature. Therefore, standard therapy is less effective for recurrent patients. To better understand the mechanisms of tumor recurrence and its treatment resistance, the tumor microenvironment (TME) of glioma is needed to be studied. The most robust and accurate method for deconvolution using CIBERSORTx is benchmarked by comparing the deconvolution results using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data and LM22 matrix with the ground truth. After finetuning the scRNA-seq-based reference matrix to yield the lowest mean square error value, we apply our single-cell transcriptome-guided glioma microenvironment deconvolution (scGMD) method to investigate the TME dynamics in longitudinal glioma samples profiled by bulk RNA sequencing.
